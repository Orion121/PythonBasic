# Assignment 2 Python And Bash

**Q1.** Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their grade based on the following scale:  
- 90 and above: Grade "A"  
- 80 to 89: Grade "B"  
- 70 to 79: Grade "C"  
- 60 to 69: Grade "D"  
- Below 60: Grade "F"  
- Here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.

**Explanation:**  
This program uses a simple `if-elif-else` conditional structure to determine the grade from the input score. 
The user inputs a numeric score, and the program outputs the corresponding grade.

**Q2.** Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. The user should be able to:  
- Add a new student and grade  
- Update an existing student’s grade  
- Print all student grades

**Explanation:**  
This program manages student data using dictionary operations. It runs in a loop to allow multiple user interactions, utilizing `if-else` statements to handle menu choices. The dictionary is updated accordingly, and data is displayed on request.

**Q3.** Write a program that creates a text file and writes some content into it using file handling functions like `open` and `write`.

**Explanation:**  
The program opens (or creates) a file named `sample.txt` in write mode and writes lines of text to it. It demonstrates basic file operations — specifically writing text content to a file in Python.

**Q4.** Write a program that reads and prints the content of a text file.

**Explanation:**  
This program opens the file `sample.txt` in read mode, reads its entire content using `file.read()`, and prints it to the console. This demonstrates how to perform file reading operations in Python.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command line interface.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python:
   python <script_name>.py
